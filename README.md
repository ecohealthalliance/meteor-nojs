# meteor-nojs-banner
Meteor.js package for displaying a floating banner
in case javascript is disabled or not supported in the browser.

The package requires no tweaking, therefore simply running
`meteor add ecosturmer:nojs-banner` within your project
will take care of integration.

If you'd like to either alter the message or customize the style of the banner,
the best way to do so would be by overriding the CSS rules that can be seen in
`nojs.css`.
